Hi, I’m Nikhath 👋

I’m a full-stack engineer who enjoys building end-to-end features - 
from clean, user-friendly interfaces to backend services that scale and behave well in production.

I like working close to real users, while also thinking about performance, reliability,
and how systems hold up once things get busy.

---

### What I enjoy working on
- Designing backend APIs that stay simple as features grow
- Building user-facing flows and wiring them to reliable services
- Thinking through edge cases, performance, and failure scenarios
- Making systems easier to debug with good logs, metrics, and dashboards

---

### What I’m exploring more deeply
- Distributed systems concepts through hands-on projects
- How storage, caching, and concurrency affect real-world performance
- Applying observability to understand system behavior, not just monitor uptime

### Things I’ve built

🧩 **End-to-end Web Platforms**  
Full-stack features with a focus on clean APIs, data modeling, and production readiness.

🗄️ **Backend & Distributed Systems Projects**  
Hands-on work exploring replication, coordination, and concurrency to understand how larger systems behave under load and failure.

🛰️ **Telemetry & Monitoring Tools**  
Pipelines that ingest and surface system data so failures are visible, actionable, and easier to reason about.

🤖 **AI-powered Applications**  
User-facing apps backed by RAG pipelines, caching, and deployment workflows, built with real-world constraints in mind.

---

### Tech I work with
**Frontend:** React, Next.js, TypeScript  
**Backend:** Java (Spring Boot), Python (FastAPI), REST, GraphQL  
**Data:** PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB  
**Infra:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, CI/CD  
**Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana

If you’re building product-focused systems that still care about engineering quality,
I’d love to connect.
