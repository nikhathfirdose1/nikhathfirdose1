# Hi, I’m Nikhath Firdose 👋
Backend & Distributed Systems Engineer | Production APIs • Reliability • Observability

I build **scalable, secure backend systems** with a strong focus on **performance, fault tolerance, and operational visibility**.  
My work spans distributed storage, high-throughput APIs, telemetry pipelines, and production cloud deployments.

- 🎓 M.S. Software Engineering (Distributed Systems), San José State University — Dec 2025
- 💼 3+ years Software Engineer @ Accenture (Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, AWS)
- 🔍 Interests: distributed systems, reliability engineering, storage systems, observability

## ⭐ Featured Projects

### 🗄️ Distributed File Storage System (GFS-inspired) — Java
- Designed and implemented the **chunk server layer** with 64MB chunking and **3× replication**
- Built heartbeat-based coordination, rebalancing, and automated recovery
- Parallelized chunk I/O using multithreading; stabilized throughput under **5K+ concurrent ops**
- Focus: concurrency control, failure handling, correctness under load

📌 *Core learning:* real-world tradeoffs in distributed storage and replication.

---

### 🛰️ TelemetryHub — Observability Pipeline (FastAPI, Celery, Prometheus, Grafana)
- Built a **low-latency telemetry pipeline** processing **50K events/sec**
- Implemented structured logging, custom metrics exporters, and dashboards
- Added LLM-driven clustering to surface failure patterns across distributed components
- Focus: reliability, backpressure handling, production monitoring

📌 *Core learning:* observability as a first-class system feature.

---

### ⚙️ High Performance Computing & RPC Benchmarking — C++, OpenMP, MPI
- Benchmarked RPC workloads on **2GB datasets** to study AOS vs SOA memory layouts
- Profiled cache behavior, context switching, and CPU scheduling on Linux
- Compared gRPC vs REST throughput and message-passing overhead

📌 *Core learning:* hardware-aware performance engineering.

---

### 🤖 AI-Powered Study Assistant — FastAPI, Next.js, FAISS
- Built a multimodal **RAG pipeline** to generate quizzes and learning plans from PDFs/audio
- Improved API throughput by **30%** using Redis caching
- Deployed on AWS with GitHub Actions CI/CD

📌 *Core learning:* applying AI systems with production constraints.
